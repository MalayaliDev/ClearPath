                                            Motion in a Plane 
 
1. Differentiate scalar and vector quantities 
      A scalar quantity has only magnitude and no direction.  
Eg.  distance , speed, mass , temperature, time ,work ,power, energy,   
pressure, frequency, angular frequency etc. 
 
      A vector quantity has  both  magnitude and  direction and obeys the 
triangle law 
      of  addition or  the parallelogram law of addition.  
       Eg. displacement, velocity, acceleration , momentum, force, 
       angular velocity, torque, angular momentum etc.  
2.When two vectors are said to be equal? 
Two vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and only if, they have the 
same magnitude and the same direction. 
    
 
        
 
3.What do you mean by null vectors or zero vector? 
A Null vector or  Zero vector  is a vector having zero magnitude and is 
represented by O or Ō . The result of adding two equal and opposite 
vectors will be a Zero vector 
Eg: When a body returns to its initial position its displacement will be a 
zero vector. 
4.What are unit vectors? 
A unit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and points in a particular 
direction. 
It has no dimension and unit. It is used to specify a direction only.

6.State triangle law of vector addition. 
If two vectors are represented  in magnitude and direction by the two 
sides of a triangle taken in order ,then their resultant is given by the third 
side of the triangle taken in reverse order.  
     
7.State parallelogram law of vector addition 
If two vectors are represented  in magnitude and direction by the  
adjacent sides of a parallelogram ,then their resultant is given by the 
diagonal of the parallelogram.

3. The word inertia means ........................ . resistance to change.  
4. What are different types of inertia? 
• Inertia of rest-The tendency of a body to remain in the state of rest. 
Eg-A person is standing in a stationary gets thrown backward when 
the bus starts suddenly.  
• Inertia of motion - The tendency of a body to remain in the state of 
uniform motion.  
Eg-The a person  standing in a moving bus gets thrown forward 
when the bus suddenly stops . 
• Inertia of direction - The tendency of a body to remain in a particular 
direction. 
Eg- When a shopping cart makes a sudden turning, the things in it 
tumble down. 
5.State Newton’s first law of motion (Law of inertia) 
Every body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a 
straight line unless compelled by some external force to change that state.  
 
6.Newton’s first law of motion describes ................... Inertia 
7.Define momentum 
 Momentum, P of a body is defined to be the product of its mass m and 
velocity v, and is denoted by p.  
                                                 p = m v 
8.State Newton’s Second Law f Motion. Write its mathematical expression.

13.Show that Newton’s  second Law is consistent  with the first law. ( or 
starting from Newton’s  second Law arrive at Newton’s  first law) 
                          
Zero acceleration implies the state of rest or uniform linear motion . i.e, 
when there is no external force , the body will remain in its state of rest or 
of uniform motion in a straight line. This is Newtons first law of motion. 
14.Define Impulse 
Impulse is the the product of force and time duration, which is the change 
in momentum of the body. 
                          Impulse = Force × time duration  
                                        I = F x t 
                                   Unit = kg m s
−1
 
15. Define Impulsive force. 
 A large force acting for a short time to produce a finite change in 
momentum is called an impulsive force.  
                   Eg: A cricket ball hitting a bat 
16. Using Newtons second law of motion arrive at Impulse momentum 
Principle  
Impulse is equal to the change in momentum of the body. 
 By Newton's second law of motion, 
                                         F=
dp
dt
 
                               F x dt = dp  
                                        I = dp  
                          Impulse = change in momentum 
17.A batsman hits back a ball straight in the direction of the bowler 
without changing its initial speed of 12 m 퐬
−ퟏ
. If the mass of the ball is 
0.15 kg, determine the impulse imparted to the ball. 
                            Impulse = change of momentum  
 Change in momentum = final momentum – initial momentum 
 Change in momentum = 0.15 × 12–(0.15×-12) 
                            Impulse = 3.6 N s 
18.Eventhough action and reaction are equal and opposite  they do not 
cancel each other .Why? 
Action and reaction forces act on different bodies, not on the same body. 
So they do not cancel each other , eventhough they are equal and opposite.

20.State the Law of Conservation of Momentum 
 The total momentum of an isolated system of interacting particles is 
conserved.                                                Or  
When there is no external force acting on a system of particles ,their total 
momentum remains constant.

34.Disadvantages of friction 
In a machine with different moving parts, friction opposes relative motion 
and thereby dissipates power in the form of heat, etc. Friction produces 
wear and tear. 
35.Advantages of friction(Friction is a necessary evil) 
 Kinetic friction  is made use of by brakes in machines and automobiles.  
 We are able to walk because of static friction.  
The friction between the tyres and the road provides the necessary 
external force to accelerate the car. 
36.Methods to reduce friction 
(1)Lubricants are a way of reducing kinetic friction in a machine.  
(2)Another way is to use ball bearings between two moving parts of a 
machine. 
(3) A thin cushion of air maintained between solid surfaces in relative 
motion is another effective way of reducing friction.

21.Why steel is preferred in heavy-duty machines and in structural 
designs? 
Young’s modulus of steel is greater  than  that of copper, brass and 
aluminium. So steel is more elastic than copper, brass and aluminium. So 
steel is preferred in heavy-duty machines and in structural designs 
22.The stress-strain graphs for materials A and B are shown in Figure. 
                           
(a) Which of the materials has the greater Young’s modulus? 
(b) Which of the two is the stronger material? 
(c)      Which of the two materials is more ductile? 
(a)   Young’s modulus Y=
 stress
  strain  
 = slpoe of the graph. 
                 Slope of  graph for material A  is greater than that of B. 
              So materials  A has the greater Young’s modulus. 
(b) Strength of a material is determined by the amount of stress 
required to cause fracture. 
The fracture point is greater for material A. 
 So material A is stronger than B 
(c) The fracture point is far apart for material  A than B. 
So material A is more ductile than B.

29.The metal ropes used in cranes are always made of a number of thin 
wires braided together.Why? 
In cranes thicker rope of radius about 3 cm is recommended. A single wire 
of this radius would practically be a rigid rod. So the ropes are always 
made of a number of thin wires braided together, like in pigtails, for ease 
in manufacture, flexibility and strength.

▪ This sections prevents buckling of beams 
▪ This section provides a large load bearing surface and enough depth 
to prevent bending.  
▪ This shape reduces the weight of the beam without sacrificing the 
strength This shape reduces the cost.

23.Explain Magnus Effect. 
                                        
The relative  velocity of air above the ball  is larger and below it is smaller. 
This difference in the velocities of air results in the pressure difference 
between the lower and upper faces and there is a net upward force on the 
ball. This dynamic lift due to spining is called Magnus effect.

24.What is an aerofoil and how a dynamic lift is produced on aircraft wing 
                                            
Aerofoil  is a solid piece shaped to provide an upward dynamic lift when it 
moves horizontally through air. When the aerofoil moves against the 
wind, the flow speed of air on top is higher than that below it. There is an 
upward force resulting in a dynamic lift of the wings and this balances the 
weight of the plane. 
25.Define viscosity 
The internal frictional  force that acts when there is relative motion 
between layers of the liquid is called viscosity. 
26.Obtain the expression for Coefficient of viscosity( 훈) 
                                          
The coefficient of viscosity( η)for a fluid is defined as the ratio of shearing 
stress to the strain rate. 
                                                                       η=

28.State Stokes’ Law 
Stokes’ law states that the viscous drag force F on a sphere of radius a 
moving with velocity v through a fluid of coefficient of viscosity η is, 
                                                             F =  6πηav 
29.What terminal velocity? 
For an object falls through a viscous medium, when viscous force plus 
buoyant force becomes equal to the weight of the body, the net force and  
acceleration become zero. Then the object  descends with a constant 
velocity called terminal velocity.

acting in the plane of the interface between the plane of the liquid and any 
other substance.

36.Some effects of surface Tension 
▪ Oil and water do not mix. 
▪ Water wets you and me but not ducks. 
▪ Mercury does not wet glass but water sticks to it. 
▪ Oil rises up a cotton wick, inspite of gravity. 
▪ Sap and water rise up to the top of the leaves of the tree.  
▪ Hairs of a paint brush do not cling together when dry and even when 
dipped in water but form a fine tip when taken out of it.

37.Define angle of contact 
The angle between tangent to the liquid surface at the point of contact and 
solid surface inside the liquid is termed as angle of contact(θ)      
▪ Angle of contact is obtuse for Water on a waxy or oily surface, 
Mercury on any surface. 
▪ Angle of contact is acute for Water on glass or on plastic,  Kerosene 
oil on virtually anything . 
 
38.Draw the angle of contact when 
a) the liquid wets the solid. 
b) the liquid does not wet the solid. 
         
           a) 
                               When  angle of contact, θ is an obtuse 
angle(greater than 90)  
 
 
          b) 
 When angle of contact,θ is an  
   acute angle (less than 90). 
 
39.Why are small drops and bubbles spherical? 
Due to surface tension ,liquid surface has the tendency  to reduce surface 
area. For a given volume sphere has minimum surface area. So small drops 
and bubbles  are spherical. 
 
40.Why are large drops and bubbles not spherical, but flattened? 
For large drops the effect of gravity predominates that of surface tension 
and they get flattened. 
41.Derive the expression for excess pressure inside a spherical drop

15.Based on the graph given below explain the anomalous expansion of 
water. 
 
Water exhibits an anomalous behavour; it contracts on heating from 0 °C  
to 4 °C. When it is heated after 4 °C ,it expands like other liquids.  
This means that water has minimum volume and hence  maximum density 
at 4 °C . 
16.Why the bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds, freeze at the top 
first? 
This is due to anomalous expansion of water. water has minimum volume 
and hence  maximum density at 4 °C . 
 As a lake cools toward 4 °C, water near the surface becomes denser, and 
sinks. Then  the warmer, less dense water near the bottom rises. When  
this layer cools to 0 °C, it freezes, and being less dense, remain at the 
surfaces. 
17.Define heat capacity 
Heat capacity (S) of a substance is the amount of heat required to raise the 
temperature of the substance by one unit.

31. The boiling point increases with increase in pressure and decreases 
with decreases in pressure. 
32 .Cooking is difficult on hills. Give reason. 
The boiling point decreases with decreases in pressure.  At high altitudes, 
atmospheric pressure is lower, boiling point of water decreases as 
compared to that at sea level. So cooking is difficult.

Convection is a mode of heat transfer by actual motion of matter. It is 
possible only in fluids. 
48.Give examples for natural convection 
Sea breeze,  Land breeze,  Trade wind 
49.Explain sea breeze. 
Sea breeze is due to natural convection. 
During the day, the ground heats up more quickly than  large water 
bodies. This is due to greater specific heat capacity of water. The air in 
contact with the warm ground is heated . It expands, becomes less dense 
and rises . Then cold air above sea  moves to fill this space  and is called as 
sea breeze . 
50.Explain land breeze 
Land breeze is due to natural convection. 
At night, the ground loses its heat more quickly, and the water surface is 
warmer than the land. The air in contact with water is heated. It expands, 
becomes less dense and rises . Then cold air  above the ground moves to 
fill this space  and is called as land breeze .

57.Explain the principle of thermo bottles. 
It consists of a double-walled glass vessel with the inner and outer walls 
coated with silver. Radiation from the inner wall is reflected back into the 
contents of the bottle. The outer wall similarly reflects back any incoming 
radiation.  
58.What is a black body? 
An object that absorbs  all radiations falling on it at all wavelength is 
called a blackbody. A blackbody, also  emits radiations of all possible 
wavelength. 
59.What are blackbody radiation? 
The radiations emitted by blackbody are called blackbody radiations.

 . Why 
When  gas is heated at constant volume, the entire heat is used  to increase 
the internal energy of the gas.  But when the gas is heated at constant 
pressure, the heat is used to increase the internal energy  and  also to do  
external work during expansion. Hence C
p
 is greater than C
v
. 
7.What are thermodynamic state variables? 
Every equilibrium state of a thermodynamic system is completely 
described by specific values of some macroscopic variables. These are  
called thermodynamic state variables. 
Eg: pressure, volume, temperature, mass , composition,Entropy, Enthalpy 
8.What do you mean by equation of state? 
The connection between the state variables  is called the equation of state. 
9.Write the e quation of statefor an ideal gas 
                                                           P V = μ R T 
10.What are extensive  variables? 
The thermodynamic variables which indicate the ‘size’ of the system are 
called extensive variables.  Eg:Internal energy,  Volume , Mass 
11.What are intensive  variables? 
The thermodynamic variables which do not indicate the ‘size’ of the 
system are called intensive variables.  Eg:
 
Pressure, Temperature , Density 
12.What is a quasi-static process? 
The name quasi-static means nearly static. 
A quasi-static process is an infinitely slow process such that the system 
remains in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with the surroundings 
throughout.  
Eg: Processes that are sufficiently slow and do not involve accelerated 
motion of the piston, large temperature gradient, etc.

23.What is a reversible processes? 
A thermodynamic process is reversible if the process can be turned back 
such that both the system and the surroundings return to their original 
states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe. 
Eg: A quasi-static isothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a cylinder   
fitted  with a frictionless movable piston is a reversible process. 
24.What is an irreversible processes? 
A thermodynamic process is irreversible if the process cannot be turned 
back such that both the system and the surroundings return to their 
original states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe. 
The spontaneous processes of nature are irreversible. 
▪ Eg:The free expansion of a gas  
▪ The combustion reaction of a mixture of petrol and air ignited by a 
spark . 
▪ Cooking gas leaking from a gas cylinder in the kitchen diffuses to the 
entire room. The diffusion process will not spontaneously reverse 
and bring the gas back to the cylinder.

                                                Kinetic Theory 
1.Real gases approach ideal gas behaviour at ............................................... 
                      Low pressures and high temperatures. 
2.State Dalton’s law of partial pressures 
The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is the sum of partial 
pressures. This is Dalton’s law of partial pressures. 
3.Write any four postulates of kinetic theory of an Ideal Gas 
• A given amount of gas is a collection of a large number of molecules  
that are in random motion. 
• At ordinary pressure and temperature, the average distance between 
molecules is  very large compared to the size of a molecule (2 Å). 
• The interaction between the molecules is negligible. 
• The molecules  make elastic collisions with each other and also with 
the walls  of the container . 
• As the collisions are elastic , total kinetic energy and total 
momentum are conserved . 
• The average kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to the 
absolute temperature of the gas. 
4.Derive the expression for pressure of an ideal gas

                                                 Oscillations 
1.What is non periodic motion? 
The motion  which is non-repetitive . 
 e.g. rectilinear motion , motion of a projectile. 
2.What is periodic motion? 
A motion that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is called periodic 
motion. 
e.g. uniform circular motion , orbital motion of planets in solar system. 
3.What is oscillatory motion? 
Periodic to and fro motion is called oscillatory motion. 
e.g.  motion of a  cradle , motion of a swing,  motion of the pendulum of a 
wall clock. 
Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but every periodic motion need not 
be oscillatory. 
4.What is the difference between oscillations and vibration? 
▪ When the frequency is small, we call it oscillation. 
          e.g.The oscillation of a branch of a tree 
▪ When the frequency is high, we call it vibration. 
         e.g. The vibration of a string of a musical instrument. 
5.What is period of oscillation? 
The period T is the time required for one complete oscillation, or cycle. 
                    Its SI unit is second. 
6.What is frequency of oscillation? 
The frequency ν of periodic or oscillatory motion is the number of 
oscillations per unit time. It is the reciprocal of period . 
                                      훎=
ퟏ
퐓
              The SI unit of ν is  hertz ( Hz). 
7.Define amplitude of oscillation. 
The maximum displacement from the mean poition is  called amplitude 
(A) of oscillation 
8.Define Simple Harmonic Motion(SHM) 
Simple harmonic motion is the motion executed by a particle subject to a 
force, which is proportional to the displacement of the particle and is 
directed towards the mean position. 
9.Write a mathematical expression for  an SHM. Explain the terms. 
                                         x (t) = A cos (ωt + 훟) 
                          x (t) =displacement,   A=amplitude , ω =angular frequency, 
                        (ωt + φ) = phase ,   φ=phase constant or initial phase angle

for their propagation are called .......................... 
                                      Mechanical waves  
                  E.g, water waves, sound waves, seismic waves, etc.  
2.The waves which not require any medium for their propagation and 
travel through vacuum at speed of light  are ..................... 
                                     Electromagnetic waves 
     Eg- visible light, ultraviolet light, radio waves, microwaves, x-rays etc.

other fundamental particles are called.............. 
                                   Matter waves. 
4.Write the characteristics of transverse waves 
▪ In transverse waves, the constituents of the medium oscillate 
perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. 
                                  
▪ They travel in the form of crests and troughs. 
▪ Transverse waves can be propagated only in  solids and strings, and 
not in fluids. 
▪ E.g, Waves on a stretched string,  
5.Write the characteristics of longitudinal waves  
▪ In longitudinal waves the constituents of the medium oscillate along 
the direction of wave propagation. 
                           
▪ They travel in the form of compressions and rarefactions. 
▪ Longitudinal waves can propagate in all elastic 
media,i.e,solids,liquids nd gases. 
▪ E.g, sound waves, vibrations in a spring. 
6.Given below are some examples of wave motion. State in each case if the 
wave motion is transverse, longitudinal or a combination of both:

32.Why open pipes are preferred over closed pipes in musical 
instruments? 
 All harmonics are possible in an open pipe, but in a cloed pipe only odd 
harmonics are possible.   
 So open pipes are preferred over closed pipes in musical instruments. 
33.Show that the frequency of fundamental mode(first harmonic) of an 
open pipe is twice that of a closed pipe.

closed pipe. 
 
34.What are beats? 
The waxing and waning (periodinc wavering)  of sound intensity when 
two waves of nearly same frequencies and amplitudes travelling in the 
same direction, are superimposed on each other is called beats.
